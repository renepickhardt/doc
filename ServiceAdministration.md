# Service Administration

I have a bunch of services running on a couple of machines and want
easy means to manage these service remotely. What I have in mind
is something similar as tomcat's manager tool, that allows me
to monitor and control different servlets installed.
What I have instead of servlets are:
* python scripts
* java tasks
* webservers

### Whishlist
* web dashboard
* Remote controled starting and stopping of services
* Service Monitoring
* Log information
* System Monitoring. CPU load.
